TODOs:

Milestone 1: Useful & fun
[X] Creating new code snippets
[X] Creating new folders
[ ] Load / Save / Import / Export
  [X] Exporting project tree to JSON string
  [X] Importing project tree from text
  [X] Saving project tree to local storage
  [X] Loading project tree from local storage
  [ ] Refactor loading, move from ProjectTree to IGS / ProjectState / somewhere (40m)
  [ ] Strategy pattern to save in different places (45m)
  [ ] Create simple save/load PHP server (2h)
  [ ] Upload project tree to PHP server for single user (1h)
  [ ] Load project tree from PHP server (30m)
  [X] Allow user to manually export/import (without localstorage) (30m)
[ ] More helper functions in imageUtil and ArrayExtension
  [X] setSize, scale, scaleBelow (30m)
  [ ] Crop, resize (keep content) (30m)
  [X] Value mapping (15m)
  [ ] Coordinate system transformations (1h)
  [X] HSL conversion (30m)
  [X] Array affect methods (20m)
  [X] Color Gradients (30m)
  [X] Color Gradient Interpolation
  [ ] Smooth Color Gradient Interpolation
  [X] Subpixel generator (15m)
[X] Importing user pictures via drag&drop or button in preview (30m)
[X] Interactive animation mode using animate((dt, t) => renderCode)
[ ] Animation pausing, resuming, stopping, variable playback speed

Milestone 2: Usability
[ ] Document Code
[ ] Rename folders / snippets 
[ ] Delete folders / snippets
[ ] Moving folders / snippets
[X] Clipping Rect for Generators and Filters
[ ] Render (fast) snippets immediately upon opening
[ ] Asynchronous non-blocking running / rendering? Maybe using asyncFilter(filterFunc, maxTimePerChunk = 2000)
[ ] Varying transitioned grid layouts to focus on specific parts of editor, e.g. only params & preview
[ ] Progress bar
[ ] General help
[ ] Parameter tutorial
[ ] enable additional parameter types
  [ ] Checkbox
  [ ] Number Input
  [ ] String Input
  [ ] Enum
  [ ] 2D slider
  [ ] Color Gradients / Hue Slider
[ ] render legend on slider parameters (min, max, ...)
[ ] parameter randomization button 
[ ] Error handling and display
[ ] disable UI while script is running
[ ] filter and gen showing previews every ~2 seconds when running too long

Milestone 3: Additional features
[ ] importing / running other snippets
[ ] Using _params as input values for other snippets
[ ] stats on script runtime
[ ] saving/restoring favorite parameter snapshots for a code snippet
[ ] Seed randomization
[ ] Advanced / non-affine pixel coord transformations (e.g. tunnel, or fractal space distribution)
[ ] Chaining transformations together
[ ] Maybe overriding canvas context draw functions when non-affine transforms are in place? -> not hardware accelerated
[ ] Keyboard shortcuts
[ ] Exporting project tree as zip
[ ] Code snippet versions
[ ] Auto executable user code (special folder?) to easily write own extensions
[ ] Syntax Highlighting
[ ] "Exporting" individual snippets to standalone web app (e.g. 30 Day Challenge tool)
[ ] Increase filtering performance by allowing lockContent(), filterStep(func), ...,  unlockContext(), reducing overhead
[ ] WebGL fragment shaders for hardware acceleration
[ ] Possibility to have special code input params to inject callbacks into other snippets

Examples:
[ ] Particle Animations
[ ] 30 Day Challenges
[ ] Box Blur
[ ] Gauss Blur, using two consecutive box blurs
[ ] Game of Life
[X] Hue Brush
[X] Rainbow Paint
[ ] Raytracing
[ ] Heightmap Paint -> smooth brushes cause smooth landscapes, not desired, more natural rough mountain brushes?
[ ] Loading Animation folder containing many different loading animations
[ ] Zoomable Mandelbrot
[ ] Parameterized Julia Set
[ ] Pythagoras Tree 
[ ] Sierpinski Triangle / Carpet
[ ] Segment Fractal
